# üéÆ Echoes of the Testnet

A spooky multiplayer web game where players are trapped in a haunted smart contract and must escape by solving puzzles while avoiding their ghostly past selves.

## üéØ Game Concept

Players find themselves trapped in a haunted smart contract where their previous actions become ghost echoes that replay on screen. Each round, you must navigate through the game area while avoiding collision with your past selves (displayed as transparent ghosts). To escape the time-loop, players must solve puzzles by inputting correct sequences of actions, which are then recorded on the Monad Testnet blockchain.
